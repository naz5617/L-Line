## IVR phone system created through the Pystrix agi 

*Started research:* 3/17/19 

*Started coding:* 3/30/19 

## Description:

Ivr phone system using the the pystrix library to access the Asterisks agi. Created in Python 3.7 this is a rough draft of the final 
product. There is more work to be completed as well as needs to recreate the Freepbx server that the whole system runs off of. 
This is mostly made with If elif statements and randomizers planning to upgrade everything to be understood in a Decision tree 
under the recommendation of a friend. I also plan to try to create functionality to have it modular to make it easy to be used in multiple situations.


## Needs:

 - [x] to have IVR functional 
 - [x] to be mostly based out of python 
 - [] to be customizable for the future
 - [] to be able to be accessed easily
 - [] to be able to add new audio files on the go 
 - [] To create an easily expandable IVR that has general capabilities
 
## Next Steps:

1. Make alternative in Decisions trees
2. Have audio files accessed by classes
3. Remake phone system.
